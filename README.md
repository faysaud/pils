# pils
simulation to find the the amount of rounds to finish a game (first time writing a simulation )

Question 1 (from Simulation and modeling of natural processes course from University of Geneva)
 Suppose you have 10 piles of of 10 coins each. 

 Say now that you are playing the following game. At each turn you pick a coin from each pile and move it in a randomly selected pile (it can be any of the piles).
  You can repeat the process an arbitrary amount of times. If a pile becomes empty, you cannot move a coin back to it. 
 Therefore if there is only one pile left the game is over.

 Can you guess the number of piles that will remain if you are allowed to play an infinite amount of turns?

 If not, the program attached "piles.py" is an implementation of this game.
  You can change the parameter maxIter which changes the maximal number of turns to get a better understanding of what is actually happening with the number of piles.
